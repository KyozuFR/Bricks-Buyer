# Bricks-Buyer                 
Solves the problem of "bricks.co" project openings at a defined time. With this you can put your investment orders a few hours in advance. (currently only available in French)                       
***Script made several years ago, there are a lot of things to improve here but I am aware of them. This will be fixed shortly.***                  

## requirement                     
install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)                          
install selenium (pip install selenium)                            
install [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new/) and the latest [geckodriver.exe](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) (**!!!geckodriver should be put at the root of the program**)           
                         
                            
## functioning                               
Create a file "mdp.txt" and put your ID at the top of the document with this syntax:                
                
                  
e-mail|password                   
                      
                        
**No spaces, no line breaks.**                    
then start the script and specify the link of the project "bricks.co" and the amount to invest                                                                     
                               
**!!!Be careful, the website has a timeout (which I don't know) so launch the script a reasonable time in advance. I tried to launch it a day before and the bot got disconnected.**
